# Blob3D fracture measurement
## Measuring the PSF
- We measured the PSF on multiple z-slices: 1184, 

### Determining the gray value for the fracture material
Based on repeated examination of the gray value on multiple slices, we determined that the gray value for air inside the fractures to be 10. 

### Measuring the fracture
We arbitrarily chose slice **1184** to measure the fracture, and we seeded a linear traverse somewhere in the middle, and used Blob3D trace feature to measure the fracture. We noticed that the fracture tracing would stop whenever there is a significant change the the fracture topology.
