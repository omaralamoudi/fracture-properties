abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Mogi1972,
abstract = {Recent laboratory studies of the fracture and flow of rocks are reviewed. New developments in laboratory apparatus have made it possible to discuss quantitatively the stress–strain relation under a wide range of geologically realistic environmental conditions. Particular effort has been devoted to strength and ductility of rocks under combined stresses. The effect of confining pressure on the fracture strength of rocks follows closely the Coulomb criterion, except for the extremely high pressure dependence at low confining pressure in some rocks which can be attributed to crack closure. However, from results of a new triaxial compression test in which all three principal stresses are different, the intermediate principal stress $\sigma$2has an important influence, so that current fracture criteria, such as Coulomb, Mohr or Griffith, are not entirely applicable. The observed behavior under combined stress is adequately described by a new fracture criterion, which has the form of a generalized Von Mises criterion. Not only fracture stress, but also the yield stress is affected by both the least compression $\sigma$3, and by the intermediate compression $\sigma$2. The other formula, obtained by generalization of the Von Mises criterion, can also be applied to this case. The ductility of rocks strongly increases with the increasing $\sigma$3, but decreases with increasing $\sigma$2. The transition from brittle to ductile state can be explained by the Orowan frictional hypothesis, when deformation in the post-yield region takes place by cataclastic flow, but the frictional hypothesis cannot be applied when large homogeneous deformation takes place in the post-yield region before fracture. Recent studies of other environmental parameters are reviewed. Effects leading to weakening and to embrittlement of rocks under conditions expected in deep regions are discussed, because of possible application to the fracture hypothesis of earthquakes. {\textcopyright} 1972, ELSEVIER PUBLISHING COMPANY},

abstract = {We report here on recent developments and advances in pore-scale X-ray tomographic imaging of subsurface porous media. Our particular focus is on immiscible multi-phase fluid flow, i.e., the displacement of one immiscible fluid by another inside a porous material, which is of central importance to many natural and engineered processes. Multiphase flow and displacement can pose a rather difficult problem, both because the underlying physics is complex, and also because standard laboratory investigation reveals little about the mechanisms that control micro-scale processes. X-ray microtomographic imaging is a non-destructive technique for quantifying these processes in three dimensions within individual pores, and as we report here, with rapidly increasing spatial and temporal resolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Cnudde2013,
abstract = {High-resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (HRXCT) or micro-CT ($\mu$CT) is a frequently used non-destructive 3D imaging and analysis technique for the investigation of internal structures of a large variety of objects, including geomaterials. Although the possibilities of X-ray micro-CT are becoming better appreciated in earth science research, the demands on this technique are also approaching certain physical limitations. As such, there remains a lot of research to be done in order to solve all the technical problems that occur when higher demands are put on the technique. In this paper, a review of the principle, the advantages and limitations of X-ray CT itself are presented, together with an overview of some current applications of micro-CT in geosciences. One of the main advantages of this technique is the fact that it is a non-destructive characterization technique which allows 4D monitoring of internal structural changes at resolutions down to a few hundred nanometres. Limitations of this technique are the operator dependency for the 3D image analysis from the reconstructed data, the discretization effects and possible imaging artefacts. Driven by the technological and computational progress, the technique is continuously growing as an analysis tool in geosciences and is becoming one of the standard techniques, as is shown by the large and still increasing number of publications in this research area. It is foreseen that this number will continue to rise, and micro-CT will become an indispensable technique in the field of geosciences. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
