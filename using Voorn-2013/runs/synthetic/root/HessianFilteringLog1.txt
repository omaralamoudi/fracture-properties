Number of files to be analysed: 27
Input files for Hessian calculation will be created
**Average material greyscale (used for calibration of the Hessian output) [avgmat]: 246
**Conservative threshold for clear fractures [consthresh]: 180
**Maximum material greyscale; to exclude bright spots [maxmat]: 255
Padding turned off
The Hessian calculations will be performed
**Hessian calculations for Gaussian kernels from 0.5 to 3 , with stepsize 0.5
