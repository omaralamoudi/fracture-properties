Number of files to be analysed: 151
Input files for Hessian calculation will be created
**Average material greyscale (used for calibration of the Hessian output) [avgmat]: 18300
**Conservative threshold for clear fractures [consthresh]: 15330
**Maximum material greyscale; to exclude bright spots [maxmat]: 27760
Padding turned off
The Hessian calculations will be performed
**Hessian calculations for Gaussian kernels from 1 to 7 , with stepsize 2
**Size of analysis blocks (Hessian): 151
The results of the Hessian calculations on various Gaussian kernels will be combined
**Hessian calculations to be included in final output: Gaussian kernels from 1 to 7 , with stepsize 2
